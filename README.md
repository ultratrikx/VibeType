    - Enable/disable features as needed

## üéØ How to Use

### Basic Usage

1. **Navigate to any website** with text input fields (Gmail, Notion, Twitter, etc.)
2. **Click on a text field** (input, textarea, or contenteditable)
3. **WebPilot sidebar appears** automatically on the right
4. **Start typing** to get real-time suggestions
5. **Use action buttons** to improve, rewrite, or elaborate your text

### Cross-Tab Context Feature

WebPilot can include context from other browser tabs to provide more relevant suggestions:

1. **Open the sidebar** by clicking on a text field
2. **Expand "Additional Tab Context"** section (click the arrow)
3. **Select a tab** from the dropdown list
4. **Click "Load Context"** to include that tab's content
5. **Get enhanced suggestions** that consider both current page and selected tab context
6. **Clear context** when no longer needed

### Enhanced Context Search

The enhanced context feature now processes content directly in the browser:

1. **Select a tab** from the dropdown
2. **Enter a search query** like "key facts about [topic]"
3. **Click "Enhanced Load" or "Search Content"**
4. WebPilot will:
    - Extract the main content from the page
    - Split it into meaningful chunks
    - Generate embeddings for each chunk using OpenAI's API
    - Find the most relevant sections based on your query
    - Show these sections for reference in your writing

**Use Cases:**

-   Writing an email while referencing information from another tab
-   Creating content based on research from multiple sources
-   Summarizing information from different web pages
-   Cross-referencing data while writing reports

### GPT Embeddings Feature

WebPilot uses GPT embeddings to analyze the current webpage and find content that's most relevant to your text:

1. **Analyze Current Page**: Click the "Analyze with GPT" button to scan the entire webpage
2. **Semantic Search**: Enter a specific query to find the most relevant content on the page
3. **Enhanced Text Actions**: When using Improve, Rewrite, or Elaborate, embeddings automatically find relevant page context
4. **Smart Chat Assistance**: Chat with the AI about the page with full context from relevant sections

How it works:

-   WebPilot parses the webpage HTML and extracts the main content
-   Content is divided into semantic chunks
-   GPT embeddings are created for each chunk
-   When you type or chat, semantic similarity search finds the most relevant content
-   The AI uses both your text and the relevant page content to provide better responses

Benefits:

-   More precise context-aware responses
-   Better understanding of long, complex webpages
-   Improved rewriting and elaboration with page-specific knowledge
-   Chat about any part of the webpage with accurate context
